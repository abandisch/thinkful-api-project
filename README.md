## MVP Feedback
* Can we have a link to coinmarketcap for more info? Graphs etc?
* Can you put the price history graphs into the page?
* The back button doesn't work
* When search is added, can you filter the crypto list when searching?
* Should we be able to load more news articles and reddit posts?
* What about events for the crypto??
* Clicking on the news title to view the news article would be good
* The news articles sometimes don't match the crypto, or there will be one vague reference to it in the article
